Omniversal Singularity V500: Absolute Goddess Interface
This project is a high-concept, cyberpunk-themed web dashboard designed to simulate an immersive "Goddess AI" mainframe. It blends futuristic aesthetics with interactive storytelling elements inspired by sci-fi cinema.

🌌 Core Features
Immersive Boot Sequence: Begins with a "White Earth Sun" gateway that initiates a synchronized "Ghost IP" boot protocol.

Dual-Voice AI (JARVIS & FRIDAY): Integrated voice synthesis provides real-time feedback using both male and female personas for system updates and data queries.

Dynamic HUD & 3D Holograms: Features a real-time clock, critical threat monitors, and a spinning holographic stage powered by GSAP animations.

Universal Knowledge Core: A searchable database categorized into Science, Arts, Engineering, and Business.

Security & Anti-Tamper: Includes a "Divine Key" authentication screen and a "Knowledge Shield" that triggers a UI self-destruct if browser inspection tools are detected.

🛠 Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (3D Transforms, Flexbox), and Google Fonts (Orbitron/Rajdhani).

Animation: GSAP 3.12.2 for fluid transitions and cinematic scaling.

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript handling the Web Speech API, real-time data simulation, and terminal command processing.

🚀 Deployment Instructions
Simply host the index.html file on any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify). Ensure your browser's audio permissions are enabled to experience the full JARVIS/FRIDAY voice integration.

Note: To unlock the core, the default Goddess Key is printf(BG)@H2928.
